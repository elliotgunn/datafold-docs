Integrating Business Intelligence applications with Datafold enables the following use cases:

1. End-to-end column-level lineage from source data to the BI assets such as reports, dashboards, and syncs.
2. Impact analysis during Deployment Testing in CI: see how changes to data transformation code impact BI assets downstream to prevent regressions.


:::note
To connecting BI tools, first create a corresponding [Data Source](/integrations/databases).

Then navigate to **Settings** &rarr; **Data Apps** and click **Add New Integration**.
