### Granting Access to Datafold Team for Troubleshooting

To help resolve support issues, you can grant Datafold Support access to your Datafold account. Granting access allows a Datafold team member to assume a user role and see the same in-app context you see reducing the back-and-forth required to resolve the issue.

To grant Datafold access to your account, navigate to (**Settings** &rarr; **Org Settings** tab) and check the box next to *"Allow Datafold access to your account for troubleshooting purposes."*

To revoke access, simply uncheck the box.
